# Python Backend Basics on Linux

This repository contains my initial backend learning tasks focused on
Python, Linux, and cybersecurity automation.

## What this project does
- Runs Linux system commands using Python
- Captures command output using subprocess
- Logs system information with timestamps
- Handles errors safely using exception handling

## Concepts used
- Python subprocess module
- Linux system commands
- File handling and logging
- datetime for timestamps
- Exception handling

## Why this matters
These tasks form the foundation for backend development and
cybersecurity automation, useful for hackathons and SIH-style projects.

## Environment
- OS: Linux
- Language: Python 3
